rag example with yugabyte

see blog at https://www.kylehailey.com/post/rag-with-yugabyte


Create a Yugabyte database here: https://cloud.yugabyte.com/

using the last available version 2.25.1 and enabled the vector extention and created a table for the vector embeddings:

<pre>CREATE EXTENSION vector;

CREATE TABLE vectors (
    id           TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    article_text TEXT,
    embedding    VECTOR(1536)
);

CREATE INDEX NONCONCURRENTLY ON vectors USING ybhnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
</pre>

see: [Yugabyte Vector Docs](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/extension-pgvector/)

<pre>
python3.9 -m venv aiblog
pip install llama-index
source aiblog/bin/activate
cd aiblog
pip install llama-index
pip install psycopg2
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your openAI key'

# in ./aiblog/rag_example/data I have a file about "paul_graham"
# you could put any textual data that in ./aiblog/data
# that you want to suppliment the LLM retrieval with
</pre>

I only needed llama-index and psycopg2 packages but you can install my full enviroment with

<pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>

git clone https://github.com/kyle-hailey/rag_example.git
cd rag_example

edit insert.py and question.py and 
modify the connection_string for your database

<pre>connection_string = "postgresql://yugabyte:password@127.0.0.1:5433/yugabyte"</pre>


Insert embeddings in Yugabyte from ./data

<pre>python insert.py</pre>

query the LLM with context from the embeddings

<pre>python question.py</pre>


<pre>$ python insert.py

💡 Answer:

Paul Graham is a writer, programmer, and entrepreneur. He has written numerous essays on various topics, some of which were reprinted as a book titled "Hackers & Painters". He has also worked on spam filters and has a passion for painting. He was known for hosting dinners for a group of friends every Thursday night, teaching him how to cook for groups. 

Before college, Graham mainly focused on writing and programming. He wrote short stories and tried programming on the IBM 1401. He later got a microcomputer and started programming more seriously, writing simple games and a word processor. In college, he initially planned to study philosophy but switched to AI. 

Graham also worked on a new dialect of Lisp, called Arc, and gave a talk at a Lisp conference about how they'd used Lisp at Viaweb. This talk gained significant attention online, leading him to realize the potential of online essays. 

In 2003, Graham met Jessica Livingston at a party. She was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank and later compiled a book of interviews with startup founders. In 2005, Graham and Livingston, along with Robert and Trevor, decided to start their own investment firm, which became Y Combinator. 

Graham also worked on several different projects, including the development of the programming language Arc and the creation of the online platform Hacker News. In 2012, he decided to hand over Y Combinator to Sam Altman and retire.</pre>
